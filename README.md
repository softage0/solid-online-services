Solid Online Services
=====================

Solid Online Services project to practice ReactJS, Redux and Webpack

You can simply access [this Heroku server](https://solid-services.herokuapp.com/) and test it.


Requirements
------------

* node `^4.2.0`
* npm `^3.0.0`


Getting Started
---------------

Just clone the repo and install the necessary node modules:

```shell
$ git clone https://github.com/softage0/solid-online-services.git
$ cd solid-online-services
$ npm install                   # Install Node modules listed in ./package.json (may take a while the first time)
$ npm start                     # Compile and launch
```

If you want to disable redux devtools, use the following command instead of `npm start`:

```shell
$ npm run dev:no-debug
```
